Place your PNG named `soffa-banner.png` in this folder (`src/assets/`).

- Recommended filename: `soffa-banner.png` (lowercase, no spaces).
- Recommended size: 1200x600 or similar aspect ratio; the banner will be displayed at 320x256 in the sidebar and will be scaled with `object-cover`.

After adding the file, refresh the dev server page — the left banner will automatically use your image if present.

If you prefer a different filename, tell me and I'll wire it up manually in `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
